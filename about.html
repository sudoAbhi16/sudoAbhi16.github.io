  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Abhinav Saraswati</strong>, a Python & AWS Developer with 4+ years of experience in BFSI and retail.
    I specialize in building <strong>scalable backend systems</strong> using Django and cloud-native microservices.
    My coding philosophy emphasizes <strong>low cognitive complexity</strong, applying 
    <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and design patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, MVC) 
    to deliver maintainable, high-performance solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy mentoring peers, simplifying complex workflows, and architecting systems that balance 
    technical depth with business impact. My recent work includes automating infrastructure testing, 
    optimizing high-volume transaction handling, and designing secure APIs that improve throughput and reliability.
